  database.  Existing installations are given a new plugin that will migrate
  existing SQLite repositories to PostgreSQL.  (RBL-2650)
* Upgrades from versions before 4.0.0 will no longer be possible with
  this version. Installations predating 4.0.0 will need to first
  be upgraded to version 4.0.1, then to this version. (RBL-2884)

  of information. In addition, a link to the full text of the license
  is provided (if license text is available). (RBL-2521)
* The footer "Help" link has been replaced with a link for the User Guide, and
  a link to the Administration Guide has been added for administrative
  users. (RBL-2622)
* It is now possible to choose a different anaconda-template, anaconda-custom
  and/or media-template when editing an existing image.  (RBL-2172)

  consisting of creating an initial version for the product.  Each product
  version can contain its own image set for launching multiple image builds
  at the same time. (RBL-2715)
* When publishing a release, there is now a checkbox option to publish the
  release to an Update Service. (RBL-2541)
* Published releases can now be marked for mirroring. When the product
  is configured appropriately, this will result in only published
  releases being mirrored to the Update Service. (RBL-2511)

  and --build-notes-file to set the build notes from the command-line
  and from a file, respectively. (RBL-2486)

Bug Fixes
---------

* A bug that prevented image builds from succeeding when a product is
  hidden has been fixed. (RBL-2619)

  from rBuilder 3.x will now update correctly. (RBL-2648)
* An error that occured when creating builds with custom
  anaconda-templates and with the XML-RPC log file enabled has been
  corrected. (RBL-2764)
* A bug in the rBuilder command-line client that caused the wrong flavor of
  anaconda-templates to be used when the flavor was not specified has
  been fixed. (RBL-2760)
* setBuildFilenames and setBuildFilenamesSafe will now allow the size of
  a build file to be a string to circumvent XML-RPC limitations.
  Likewise, getBuildFilenames now returns the size as a string for the
  same reason. (RBL-2789)
* Compatibility with Firefox 3 has been restored. (RBL-2774)

Internal Changes
----------------
* rBuilder now requires Conary 2.0. (RBL-2580)
* The same rBuilder codebase may be built for rBuilder Online as well as
  rBuilder Appliance; for rBuilder Online, this means that the 'rBuilderOnline'
  configuration parameter must be set to True. Additionally, links to legal
  information is now managed outside the codebase; use "legaleseLink",
  "privacyPolicyLink", and "tosLink" to point to legal information,
  privacy policy and terms of service home pages, respectively.
* Links to the Appliance Logs viewer have been added to the Inbound and 
  Outbound Mirror plugin. (RBL-2918)

  (RBL-2287)
* Accept non-admin rAPA users when adding an outbound mirror target.
  (RBL-2408)
* Remove an unused and invalid CSS style that caused warnings in some
  browsers. (RBL-2450)
* The appliance agent log file is now viewable in the Appliance Agent log
  viewer. (RBL-2451)
* Build types may be now included in /srv/rbuilder/config/rbuilder-custom.conf
  using the includeBuildType directive. Previously, one would have to modify
  /srv/rbuilder/config/rbuilder.conf and remove the "excluded" build type
  in order to include it. This change would have to be re-applied upon each
  subsequent update as rbuilder.conf is treated as a template and is
  overwritten. (RBL-2458)
* rBuilder command line client may now be installed on systems running
  Conary 2.0. (RBL-2477)
* The seldom-used rMake web UI integration has been removed. (RBL-2516)

Build System Changes
--------------------

* The build system now uses Xen 3.1.0 and Linux kernel 2.6.20
  for enhanced stability and better hardware support.
* Zombie processes are no longer left behind if the anaconda template
  web service fails to build and cache the template. (RBL-2323)
* The partition sizing algorithm used in previous versions of the Job
  Slave caused some builds to prematurely run out of space when building
  an image. (RBL-2330)
* Images built by rBuilder Appliance now pin the kernel package. (RBL-2412)
* The anaconda template web service now uses the Conary proxy provided by
  rBuilder when generating templates. (RBL-2429)
* Previous versions of the Job Master left behind lock files which prevented
  a new job slave image from being created in the case of a system failure.
  These lock files are now cleaned up when the Job Master starts. (RBL-2444)
* The Conary client used by the Job Slaves was configured incorrectly to use
  /var/tmp instead of /tmp when building images. This resulted in the
  Job Slave process failing to build the job due to lack of disk space.
  (RBL-2461)
* Compatibility changes have been made to support newer anaconda-templates
  using the latest rPath Linux development images. This only affects users
  building bleeding-edge builds using the latest anaconda-templates.
  (RBL-2493)
* Builds that were migrated from rBuilder 3.x can now be rebuilt using the
  most recent Job Slave version. (RBL-2484)
* Image builds of groups that reference troves on a hidden project now
  work if the creator of the build has access to those troves. (RBL-2120)


Changes in 4.0.0
================

* rBuilder can build 64-bit bootable images for all image build types.
* The VMware image types create a gzip tar archive, eliminating the previous
  4 GB limitation for such images.
* Group Builder uses group-appliance-platform from rPath Linux to provide basic
  operating system components. (RBL-1865)
* Each image build shows a SHA-1 message digest on its build page.
* Image builds are handled with a new system that works on top of Xen
  technology. Each build job is handled inside a Xen DomU. The goal of this job
  system is to make image builds faster.
* The rPath Appliance Platform Agent interface includes a "Job Control Console"
  page for managing image build jobs.
* Outbound mirroring allows for selecting one or more groups to mirror.
  (RBL-2351)
* Outbound mirroring by group recurses the selected group for all its contents
  and subgroups.
* When uploading GPG keys, projects are listed in alphabetical order.
  (RBL-2084)
* When uploading GPG keys, external projects are not listed. (RBL-2085)
* Apache logs have been consolidated into a single log. (RBL-2037)
* rBuilder logs are kept in /var/log/rbuilder (previously in
  /srv/rbuilder/logs).
* Fixed: VMware ESX images had the wrong guestOS setting in the VMX file.
  (RBL-2338)
* Fixed: Including troves from external projects caused permission issues when
  building images. (RBL-2184)
* Fixed: RepositoryMismatch errors occured when mirroring from an external
  project in caching mode. (RBL-2241)
* Fixed: An infinite loop and lock-up was created by certain Conary proxy
  errors. (RBL-1664)
* Fixed: When two or more outbound mirrors were configured for different
  labels, the rPath Appliance Platform Update Service would confuse the
  authentication and return insufficient permission errors. (RBL-2318)
* Known issue: When configuring the target for an outbound mirror in rBuilder,
  if the Update Service appliance user has a role of mirror and does not have a
  role of admin, mirroring will not work when mirroring by group.

Changes in 3.1.4
================
* A change in Conary's entitlement handling inadvertantly broke the
  edit external projects admin page when using entitlements for access.
  This has been corrected to match the new behavior. (RBL-1849)
* Entitlement and user/password information from external projects is
  now injected into the proxy repository server, so unauthorized clients
  using rBuilder as a proxy will gain all of the access that rBuilder
  is entitled to. (RBL-1886)

Changes in 3.1.3
================

* rBuilder's internal proxy now uses the correct urlBase containing
  the rBuilder's hostname instead of localhost.
* A minor corner case was fixed in the diff code in the repository
  browser.
* Fixes for LiveCD generation.
* In previous versions of rBuilder, it was possible to enter an
  invalid hostname when creating an external project. rBuilder will
  now check the hostname's validity before creating the external project.

Changes in 3.1.2
================
* rBuilder now contains an internal caching Conary proxy.
* The repository browser now displays the packages that are included in a
  group or sub-group. (RBL-654)
* The repository browser now displays a graphical "diff" of individual
  files modified in a shadow. (RBL-656)
* The repository browser now displays a shadow's derivation tree. (RBL-658)
* The repository browser now displays a version list, by label, in a tree
  view. (RBL-1393)
* The repository browser now displays where a trove was cloned from. (RBL-1394)
* rBulder can now serve files larger than 2G. (RBL-1495)
* The repository browser now displays expandable/abbreviated versions
  of versions and flavors. (RBL-1558)
* A plugin for scheduling outbound mirroring has been added. (RBL-1558)
* In the event of an unhandled error, rBuilder now displays a custom
  500 page containing support information. (RBL-1574)
* The external project entitlement form now protects against white
  space. (RBL-1386)
* GPG-compatible keyserver interface has been exposed in the repository
  browser. (RBL-1488)
* The builds page no longer backtraces if an unknown architecture is
  encountered. (RBL-1524)
* An additional status message has been added before copying starts in

  browse pages.

Changes in 2.0.0
================
* Rearchitected the releases system, and replaced it with releases and builds.
* Releases can now consist of an arbitrary set of builds; a build
  is a combination of group-trove (trove, version, flavor) + build type
  (ISO, VMware, QEMU, etc.).
* Added release unpublish capability; unpublishing a release will hide the
  release from the public, and allows you to edit the release contents.
* Project developers are now able to create and delete builds (e.g.
  for testing purposes). Creating, publishing and deleting builds is still
  the exclusive domain of the project owner(s).
* Releases may now be deleted after being published.

  now in /srv/rbuilder/rbuilder.conf.
* Projects created using rBA may use a custom domain name.
* rBA administrator interface now has a link to rAA for managing
  system updates, entitlements, etc.

  user information page respectively, instead of the administrator page.
* Administrative interface now matches the site layout.
* The ability to browse and search for users has been exposed for
  administrators only.

  users if the client has administrative privileges.
* The ability to disable projects has been removed. The "disabled" column,
  however, still exists in the Projects table, but is ignored.
* A bug in raw2vmdk which caused occasional miscalculation of the disk
  metadata size has been fixed.
* The download landing page has been removed, and an alternate method for
  download tracking using Google Analytics has been implemented.
* The "show media check" option for installable ISOs now behaves correctly.
  The sense used to be backwards: selecting "show media check" would skip
  the media check, and vice-versa.
* Users with admin privileges on project repositories can now alter
  low-level Conary groups and permissions.
* Swap file size on bootable images is now configurable.
* A kernel is not required when building a bootable image. This can be
  for certain image types and applications.
* The group cook "stock flavors" were updated to "prefer" almost every use 
  flag, to avoid problems where a package cooked with a ! or !~ flavor 
  would not be found by the group cook system.
* The installable CD now supports duplicated changeset filenames by
  appending a count to the end of the filename. This fixes a bug when
  including two troves of the same name and version, but different flavor.
* Google Analytics code is now disabled by default. Enable it by specifying
  "googleAnalyticsTracker True" in the mint configuration file.
* Refactoring of code; removed relative imports from the main codebase (except
  for tests and scripts).
* Refactored admin backend, url changed to /admin/ from /administer/ 
  (the latter still works, to preserve bookmarks).
* Extended characters in the group trove description no longer break the cook
  process with an "invalid type for set" error. Extended characters are
  converted to '?' when passed into Conary.
* Component Removal from Group Builder now exists. For now the settings are in
  the 'Edit Group' dialog. The location may change.
* Client cookie settings are tested at login instead of silently failing.
* Outbound mirroring uses matchTroves instead of excludedTroves
    NOTE: This change requires rBO/A to use conary 1.0.17 or later.

Changes in 1.6.1
================
* Bootable images now save the taghandler script and the output
  of that script in /root/, the same way the installable CD does.
