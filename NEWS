Changes in @NEW@
================

Web Front End Changes
---------------------

* "Projects" are now referred to as "products" in rBuilder Appliance.
  (RBL-1641)
* "Builds" are now referred to as "images". (RBL-2645)
* The form for creating new products has been updated to ask for the project
  title, short name, type (Appliance or Component) and initial version number
  (RBL-2508), and the Repository Commits Email address (RBL-2590)
* The initial setup page has a new option under "Repository Setup" to specify
  the namespace to be used by products. (RBL-2564)
* New products will have an initial development label created in the format
  <shortname>.<domainname>@<namespace>:<shortname>-<version>-devel. (RBL-2508)
* A bug that prevented a group trove from being cooked more than one time
  by Group Builder has been corrected. (RBL-2570)
* The Group Builder has been removed from rBA, to be replaced by a different
  mechanism to get appliances built quickly. (RBL-2514)
* The Conary repository permission management web user interface has
  been modified to use the term "Role" instead of "Group". (RBL-2580)
* New appliance projects will be prepopulated with a sample group recipe ready
  for extending. (RBL-2515)
* The License and Crypto report has been improved.  Now only the
  information is only displayed for packages, instead of displaying
  the same information for every package component.  A link to the
  full text of the license is provided if available. (RBL-2521)
* The footer "Help" link has been replaced with a link for the User Guide, and
  a link to the Administration Guide has been added for admin users. (RBL-2622)

Internal Changes
----------------
* rBuilder now requires Conary 2.0. (RBL-2580)

Command-Line Client Changes
---------------------------

* The command-line client's build-create command now accepts the --name option
  to set the name of the new build, and --build-notes and --build-notes-file
  to set the build notes from the command-line and from a file, respectively.
  (RBL-2486)

Bug Fixes
---------

* A bug that prevented image builds from succeeding when a project is
  hidden has been fixed. (RBL-2619)
* A bug that would cause an Internal Server Error when attempting to
  generate a License and Crypto report if the underlying Conary
  repository operation failed has been fixed. (RBL-2595)
* Commit mail, recent commits, and other data on installations migrated
  from rBuilder 3.x will now update correctly. (RBL-2648)


Changes in 4.0.1
================

Web Front End Changes
---------------------

* Project owners and admins may now configure a project to send commit mail
  to arbitrary e-mail addresses. (RBL-1568)
* Uploading an invalid GPG key no longer causes the web UI to backtrace.
  (RBL-1625)
* A regression in the anaconda-templates trove picker in the advanced build
  option has been fixed. (RBL-1760)
* Apache's access_log and error_log may now be viewed and downloaded from
  the Appliance Agent log viewer. (RBL-2250)
* Accessing help in project resources now opens a new {window, tab}.
  (RBL-2287)
* Accept non-admin rAPA users when adding an outbound mirror target.
  (RBL-2408)
* Remove an unused and invalid CSS style that caused warnings in some
  browsers. (RBL-2450)
* The appliance agent log file is now viewable in the Appliance Agent log
  viewer. (RBL-2451)
* Build types may be now included in /srv/rbuilder/config/rbuilder-custom.conf
  using the includeBuildType directive. Previously, one would have to modify
  /srv/rbuilder/config/rbuilder.conf and remove the "excluded" build type
  in order to include it. This change would have to be re-applied upon each
  subsequent update as rbuilder.conf is treated as a template and is
  overwritten. (RBL-2458)
* rBuilder command line client may now be installed on systems running
  Conary 2.0. (RBL-2477)
* The seldom-used rMake web UI integration has been removed. (RBL-2516)
* Removed the Mirror URL option under advanced options for building. (RBL-2470)

Build System Changes
--------------------

* The build system now uses Xen 3.1.0 and Linux kernel 2.6.20
  for enhanced stability and better hardware support.
* Zombie processes are no longer left behind if the anaconda template
  web service fails to build and cache the template. (RBL-2323)
* The partition sizing algorithm used in previous versions of the Job
  Slave caused some builds to prematurely run out of space when building
  an image. (RBL-2330)
* Images built by rBuilder Appliance now pin the kernel package. (RBL-2412)
* The anaconda template web service now uses the Conary proxy provided by
  rBuilder when generating templates. (RBL-2429)
* Previous versions of the Job Master left behind lock files which prevented
  a new job slave image from being created in the case of a system failure.
  These lock files are now cleaned up when the Job Master starts. (RBL-2444)
* The Conary client used by the Job Slaves was configured incorrectly to use
  /var/tmp instead of /tmp when building images. This resulted in the
  Job Slave process failing to build the job due to lack of disk space.
  (RBL-2461)
* Compatibility changes have been made to support newer anaconda-templates
  using the latest rPath Linux development images. This only affects users
  building bleeding-edge builds using the latest anaconda-templates.
  (RBL-2493)
* Builds that were migrated from rBuilder 3.x can now be rebuilt using the
  most recent Job Slave version. (RBL-2484)
* Image builds of groups that reference troves on a hidden project now
  work if the creator of the build has access to those troves. (RBL-2120)


Changes in 4.0.0
================

* rBuilder can build 64-bit bootable images for all image build types.
* The VMware image types create a gzip tar archive, eliminating the previous
  4 GB limitation for such images.
* Group Builder uses group-appliance-platform from rPath Linux to provide basic
  operating system components. (RBL-1865)
* Each image build shows a SHA-1 message digest on its build page.
* Image builds are handled with a new system that works on top of Xen
  technology. Each build job is handled inside a Xen DomU. The goal of this job
  system is to make image builds faster.
* The rPath Appliance Platform Agent interface includes a "Job Control Console"
  page for managing image build jobs.
* Outbound mirroring allows for selecting one or more groups to mirror.
  (RBL-2351)
* Outbound mirroring by group recurses the selected group for all its contents
  and subgroups.
* When uploading GPG keys, projects are listed in alphabetical order.
  (RBL-2084)
* When uploading GPG keys, external projects are not listed. (RBL-2085)
* Apache logs have been consolidated into a single log. (RBL-2037)
* rBuilder logs are kept in /var/log/rbuilder (previously in
  /srv/rbuilder/logs).
* Fixed: VMware ESX images had the wrong guestOS setting in the VMX file.
  (RBL-2338)
* Fixed: Including troves from external projects caused permission issues when
  building images. (RBL-2184)
* Fixed: RepositoryMismatch errors occured when mirroring from an external
  project in caching mode. (RBL-2241)
* Fixed: An infinite loop and lock-up was created by certain Conary proxy
  errors. (RBL-1664)
* Fixed: When two or more outbound mirrors were configured for different
  labels, the rPath Appliance Platform Update Service would confuse the
  authentication and return insufficient permission errors. (RBL-2318)
* Known issue: When configuring the target for an outbound mirror in rBuilder,
  if the Update Service appliance user has a role of mirror and does not have a
  role of admin, mirroring will not work when mirroring by group.

Changes in 3.1.4
================
* A change in Conary's entitlement handling inadvertantly broke the
  edit external projects admin page when using entitlements for access.
  This has been corrected to match the new behavior. (RBL-1849)
* Entitlement and user/password information from external projects is
  now injected into the proxy repository server, so unauthorized clients
  using rBuilder as a proxy will gain all of the access that rBuilder
  is entitled to. (RBL-1886)

Changes in 3.1.3
================

* rBuilder's internal proxy now uses the correct urlBase containing
  the rBuilder's hostname instead of localhost.
* A minor corner case was fixed in the diff code in the repository
  browser.
* Fixes for LiveCD generation.
* In previous versions of rBuilder, it was possible to enter an
  invalid hostname when creating an external project. rBuilder will
  now check the hostname's validity before creating the external project.

Changes in 3.1.2
================
* rBuilder now contains an internal caching Conary proxy.
* The repository browser now displays the packages that are included in a
  group or sub-group. (RBL-654)
* The repository browser now displays a graphical "diff" of individual
  files modified in a shadow. (RBL-656)
* The repository browser now displays a shadow's derivation tree. (RBL-658)
* The repository browser now displays a version list, by label, in a tree
  view. (RBL-1393)
* The repository browser now displays where a trove was cloned from. (RBL-1394)
* rBulder can now serve files larger than 2G. (RBL-1495)
* The repository browser now displays expandable/abbreviated versions
  of versions and flavors. (RBL-1558)
* A plugin for scheduling outbound mirroring has been added. (RBL-1558)
* In the event of an unhandled error, rBuilder now displays a custom
  500 page containing support information. (RBL-1574)
* The external project entitlement form now protects against white
  space. (RBL-1386)
* GPG-compatible keyserver interface has been exposed in the repository
  browser. (RBL-1488)
* The builds page no longer backtraces if an unknown architecture is
  encountered. (RBL-1524)
* An additional status message has been added before copying starts in
  mirror preload. (RBL-1551)
* A UDP port has been opened for monitoring via SNMP. (RBL-1571)
* Group Builder now pulls rAA from raa.rpath.org@rpath:raa-2. (RBL-1572)
* Hard-coded reference to raa.rpath.org removed have been. (RBL-1536)
* Inbound/Outbound mirroring operations now configure a complete set of
  repository map entries. (RBL-1579)</p></li>
* The repository browser now displays files for the flavor selected. (RBL-1581)
* The correct project name is now displayed when a user adds a GPG 
  key. (RBL-1625)
* rBuilder can now push to multiple mirrors simultaneously. (RBL-1520)

Changes in 3.1.0
================
* rBuilder's Repository Browser uses a different color in the file list
  to indicate files modified in a shadowed package. (RBL-657)
* Administrators have the option in a mirror to include all labels of an
  inbound mirrored repository. (RBL-1474)
* Administrators can order inbound and outbound mirror operations if
  necessary for dependencies. (RBL-1305)
* rBuilder no longer restricts the file size for bootable image
  generation. (RBL-1312)
* Administrators can convert any project from a mirrored project to an
  external (network access) project, and from external to 
  mirrored. (RBL-1292)
* When a mirrored project is restored from backup, rBuilder converts it
  to an external project. (RBL-1291)
* Installable CDs include all public keys needed to validate signed
  packages on the disk. (RBL-1416)
* The Repository Browser and command line interface each have a method
  to search derived and referenced packages. (RBL-1412)
* Some bugs in the external project editing have been fixed. (RBL-1243)
* The specific option to add an external project and preload with a disk
  drive has been removed. The same functionality is available if you
  select "Do not mirror this repository". In-line documentation has been
  updated. (RBL-1323)
* Usernames for rBuilder accounts follow new Conary restrictions. (RBL-1338)
* The "Notify All Users" functionality has been removed. (RBL-1370)
* In certain circumstances, rBuilder could set up an external Update Service
  with the wrong hostname for mirror contents. This has been fixed. (RBL-1369)
* rBuilder previously did not create some Anaconda installer files for
  bootable images.  This has been fixed. (RBL-1328)

Changes in 3.0.0
================

Features
--------
* rBuilder now supports Microsoft Virtual Hardware (VHD) as well as
  Virtual Iron build types. (RBL-1198)
* The "VMware Player Image" build type is now known as "VMware Virtual
  Appliance". (RBL-1274)
* Users who are currently building a group with Group Builder will have their
  package searches restricted to packages having the same namespace:tag
  (e.g. rpl:1) as the version of group-core currently included
  in the group they are building. (RBL-629)
* Inbound mirror operations may now be scheduled via rAA. (RBL-1157)
* Inbound and outbound mirror logging has been enhanced. (RBL-1242)
* It is now possible to delete multiple builds from the "manage builds"
  web interface. (RBL-1195)

  browser. (RBL-1177)
* Download statistics are now available as a chart. (RBL-1213)
* The release description page now contains date/time information
  about a given release.

Fixes
-----
* The mirror preload operation now checks for sufficient free disk
  space before importing.  (RBL-1014)
* Maintenance mode no longer creates a redirect loop when attempting
  to access the web interface while logged in. (RBL-1028)
* The Cook Group button on the Edit Group page now saves any group recipe
  changes before cooking the group. (RBL-1085)
* It is no longer necessary to press shift-reload to properly refresh
  the page after upgrading rBuilder. (RBL-1017)
* Logging in from pages with GET parameters (e.g. search pages)
  works again. (RBL-1240)
* The Start Job Server button on the Manage Jobs screen now functions
  properly. Also, the job server status information is formatted to
  be easier to read. (RBL-1245)
* Demo CD/DVDs now have /etc/mtab as a symlink to /proc/mounts.
  (RBL-1225)
* Developers can now see unpublished releases in the list view.
  (RBL-968)
* group-raa is now included in the list of groups to initially populate
  a group trove. (RBL-925)
* Users may now restrict their project search results to projects which
  have published releases containing builds with the desired build
  types.
* Page rendering fixed when a user with more than five projects is
  logged in. (RBL-1253)
* Clicking on a package in a search will take you to the proper version
  of the package in the repository browser. (RBL-1264)
* Backups to Samba shares now function properly. (RBL-1293)
* Outbound mirroring now uses /srv/rbuilder/tmp instead of /tmp.
  (RBL-1295)
* The "(show more builds)" link on the "Manage/View Builds" pages --
  which appeared if a project had more than ten builds -- was
  removed, as it did not function properly under some browsers.
  (RBL-868)
* Recreating a build that uses an older jobserver no longer causes
  the jobserver to crash. (RBL-1318)
* Committing to an rBuilder-hosted repository with incorrect credentials
  now gives an appropriate error message as opposed to a stacktrace.
  (RBL-1296)
* Restarting Apache is no longer necessary when adding an external
  project to rBuilder. (RBL-1347)
* The  default Anaconda artwork no longer says "Created by rBuilder Online"
  when being built by the rBuilder Appliance. (RBL-1281)
* System update entitlements are no longer incorrectly used for inbound
  mirror updates. (RBL-1308)

  exits before all data is consumed in the pipeline. (RBL-1276)

Changes in 2.1.1
================
* VMware builds now complete successfully. (RBL-1297)

Changes in 2.1.0
================
* VMware ESX image creation (RBL-1139)
* Xen DomU option when cooking a group (RBL-609)

* Several other bug fixes and UI enhancements (multiple issues)

Changes in 2.0.3
================
* rBuilder's configuration file now supports overrides via two files
  rbuilder-generated.conf and rbuilder-custom.conf. rbuilder-generated.conf
  is updated via the "first-time setup" mode of rBuilder and should not
  be edited by hand. rbuilder-custom.conf is to be used for "site-local"
  configuration. Both of these files are in /srv/rbuilder/config.
  It is important to note that /srv/rbuilder/rbuilder.conf will be 
  overwritten upon any future update to rBuilder and therefore should not 
  be edited by a customer or SE under any circumstances. (RBL-1047)

Changes in 2.0.2
================
* S3 support.
* The "search/browse entries per page" setting now properly applies to
  browse pages.

Changes in 2.0.0
================
* Rearchitected the releases system, and replaced it with releases and builds.
* Releases can now consist of an arbitrary set of builds; a build
  is a combination of group-trove (trove, version, flavor) + build type
  (ISO, VMware, QEMU, etc.).
* Added release unpublish capability; unpublishing a release will hide the
  release from the public, and allows you to edit the release contents.
* Project developers are now able to create and delete builds (e.g.
  for testing purposes). Creating, publishing and deleting builds is still
  the exclusive domain of the project owner(s).
* Releases may now be deleted after being published.
* Added XMLRPC call logging similar to Conary's, controlled by the 
  xmlrpcLogFile config entry. (RBL-12)
* Fixed a bug where a directory with a symlink pointing to it could
  possibly be created with the wrong permissions in a bootable image.
  (RBL-695)
* Searching (all types) will prioritize exact matches above all other results.
* rBuilder can command an rMake server local to the web browser's machine.

  mechanism making it easier to choose the particular flavor of a group.
* Custom output filenames can now be specified for builds.
* Xen support has been added to the group builder "cook group" dialog.
* Opening two "create release" pages at once no longer gives "requested
  item not found" (RBL-408)
* External password checking URLs can now be used.
* The tar archive from mirror priming is now deleted after a successful
  extraction. (RBL-830)
* VMware images now default to bridged networking mode.

Changes in 1.6.3
================
* Installation paths changed: /srv/mint is now /srv/rbuilder; configuration is
  now in /srv/rbuilder/rbuilder.conf.
* Projects created using rBA may use a custom domain name.
* rBA administrator interface now has a link to rAA for managing
  system updates, entitlements, etc.
* Projects and users are now administered via the project home page and
  user information page respectively, instead of the administrator page.
* Administrative interface now matches the site layout.
* The ability to browse and search for users has been exposed for
  administrators only.
* Project and user browse/search will include hidden projects and unconfirmed
  users if the client has administrative privileges.
* The ability to disable projects has been removed. The "disabled" column,
  however, still exists in the Projects table, but is ignored.
* A bug in raw2vmdk which caused occasional miscalculation of the disk
  metadata size has been fixed.
* The download landing page has been removed, and an alternate method for
  download tracking using Google Analytics has been implemented.
* The "show media check" option for installable ISOs now behaves correctly.
  The sense used to be backwards: selecting "show media check" would skip
  the media check, and vice-versa.
* Users with admin privileges on project repositories can now alter
  low-level Conary groups and permissions.
* Swap file size on bootable images is now configurable.
* A kernel is not required when building a bootable image. This can be
  for certain image types and applications.
* The group cook "stock flavors" were updated to "prefer" almost every use 
  flag, to avoid problems where a package cooked with a ! or !~ flavor 
  would not be found by the group cook system.
* The installable CD now supports duplicated changeset filenames by
  appending a count to the end of the filename. This fixes a bug when
  including two troves of the same name and version, but different flavor.
* Google Analytics code is now disabled by default. Enable it by specifying
  "googleAnalyticsTracker True" in the mint configuration file.
* Refactoring of code; removed relative imports from the main codebase (except
  for tests and scripts).
* Refactored admin backend, url changed to /admin/ from /administer/ 
  (the latter still works, to preserve bookmarks).
* Extended characters in the group trove description no longer break the cook
  process with an "invalid type for set" error. Extended characters are
  converted to '?' when passed into Conary.
* Component Removal from Group Builder now exists. For now the settings are in
  the 'Edit Group' dialog. The location may change.
* Client cookie settings are tested at login instead of silently failing.
* Outbound mirroring uses matchTroves instead of excludedTroves
    NOTE: This change requires rBO/A to use conary 1.0.17 or later.

Changes in 1.6.1
================
* Bootable images now save the taghandler script and the output
  of that script in /root/, the same way the installable CD does.
* A warning now appears at the top of the project page if the project's
  FQDN is not resolvable.
* Mailing lists are now created with the default options to reject all
  non-member posts.
* "Remember me on this computer" now functions as expected.
* Search results have a better UI.
* The projects pane expands to fit the contents.
* The IP address of the job server is now correctly recorded in the JobData
  table.
* The group cook page uses the new status dialog.

Changes in 1.6.0
================
* Redirects in the group builder are now handled more correctly
  the correct flavored redirect will be pulled in automatically.
* Group Builder conflicts have been modified to behave more intuitively.
  User specified troves will always replace troves pulled in from deps.

* Hidden and disabled projects no longer try to appear in the project
  browser, triggering a permission denied error.
* Searches are now case-insensitive.
* ISO generation copies isolinux.bin into the target dir instead of just
  linking, since it is changed.

  move them to authUser and authPass.
* iso_gen.conf now contains an SSL flag which must match the mint configuration.
* A bug in the downloadImage handler has been fixed.
* Some of the plain-text emails have been rewritten to use kid 0.8's new
  PlainSerializer. This is to avoid having lots of content embedded in the
  source code.
* Attempts to access a non-existent repository using wildcard dns or
  /repos/broken-repo-name/ now respond with an HTTP 404 error, instead of
  a 500 Internal Server Error.
* Add support for creating Bootable Qemu Images
* Add support for creating bootable VMWare Images
* Refactor the job server to generate multiple image types from a single

Changes in 1.1.3
================
* 1.1.2 was never launched to the live site.

  the server from forking off to a separate process.

Changes in 1.1.2
================
* The JobData and ReleaseData tables are now abstracted into a new
  GenericDataTable for future reuse.  As part of this change the JobData table
  will be dropped and recreated.  As such any jobs happening during the upgrade

  database file directly instead of spawning an http access, and many
  more small improvements.
* MySQL support is included, but not turned on by default.
* Group troves in the repository browser show contained troves instead of files.
