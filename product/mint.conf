dbPath          @DESTDIR@/srv/mint/data/db

# Path to the rBuilder-hosted Conary repositories
# (Each project receives a dedicated directory under this path, containing both
# a database and all the changeset data.)
reposPath       @DESTDIR@/srv/mint/repos/

# Path to the rBuilder-hosted Conary repository contents,
# if different from above.
# (This allows you to store the changeset data files on a SAN or NFS share,
# leaving the individual repository databases on the local system.  A link is

# Flag controlling whether SSL is used by the site
SSL             False 

# If SSL is True, this must match the domain name of your SSL certificate on

# Domain of the rBuilder site
# (Used to describe the site in user interactions)
siteDomainName      example.com

# Hostname to access the rBuilder site
# The complete URL to access rBuilder is built up of
# hostName and siteDomainName. Eg., www.example.com

# The root directory in your URL which will house your rBuilder installation.
# Note that this path CAN be changed to '/', but that configuration requires
# much more configuration of apache.
# The full URL for rBuilder will be http(s)://{hostname}.{siteDomainName}{basePath}

# This is a Conary-style repositoryMap for rBuilder's authentication
# database.  The URL requires a username and password (the account will be

# This is an analogue to the repositoryMap line in a conaryrc configuration
# file.  Note that the first part of the map must match what you have set in
# your authrepo.cnr file for serverName.

#commitEmail rbuilder@example.com

# Command to be executed during each commit
# Depending on the architecture of the system, some of the /usr/lib paths need
# to be changed to match the system, and the --url parameter to rbuilderaction.py
# must be changed to point to this rBuilder installation.
# You may also need to change the --email option in the changemail line to
# match your system.  If you do not specify a commit action, no action will be
# taken.
# an example with hardcoded paths:
# commitAction    /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/conary/scripts/commitaction --repmap '%(repMap)s' --build-label %(buildLabel)s \
