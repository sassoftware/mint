DATABASE 

* a separate database table for namespaces; maybe not needed; maybe we can use Labels table?
* refactor mint -> imagetool-backend, imagetool (product frontend), mint (public frontend)

TEST SUITE

* test suite improvements
    * be able to test membership levels (trouble is accessing new project's repository by hostname
      which doesn't really exist)
    * check coverage
    * test image creation

JOB SERVER

* improve job-server
    * more robust (handle server restarts, etc)

USER INTERFACE

* [SORT OF DONE] Fix 'most active' and 'most popular' project links
 - We need to parse the Commits table and downloads counter and distill some real
   statistical information to use for these links.
* Fix up news handling

MISSING FEATURES

* [POSTPONED] Bug tracking
* Metadata editing for packages (blocking on Conary metadata handling)
* Each project site should have a sidebar with recently updated packages
  (see http://www.archlinux.org/)

ADMIN INTERFACE

* Server -> User messaging system
 - we need an in-band way for users to ask to join a project (only one time
   to prevent DoS-style issues with hundreds of join requests), and for
   project owners to offer membership.
