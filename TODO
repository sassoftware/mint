DATABASE 

* eliminate the Project.getLabel() and [getRepoMap, addLabel, getLabelIds,
  getLabelById] duplication.
* a separate database table for namespaces; maybe not needed; maybe we can use Labels table?

* refactor mint -> imagetool-backend, imagetool (product frontend), mint (public frontend)

TEST SUITE

* test suite improvements
    * be able to test membership levels (trouble is accessing new project's repository by hostname
      which doesn't really exist)
    * check coverage
    * test image creation

JOB SERVER

* improve job-server
    * more robust (handle server restarts, etc0
* [DONE needs beta testing] cron jobs for mail list handling

USER INTERFACE

* Implement static pages for privacy policy and terms of service (see Ed
for privacy policy text and http://www.lipsum.com/ for our terms of service
-- say, about 20 paragraph's worth)

* Implement "cancel account"
* New users should not be listed under "all users" until the account is confirmed. They effectively don't exist yet...
* Implement a few static-text pages: about rpath, ToS, privacy, contact into, products
* [SORT OF DONE] Fix 'most active' and 'most popular' project links
 - We need to parse the Commits table and downloads counter and distill some real
   statistical information to use for these links.
* Fix 'more about rpath' link
* Fix up news handling
 - create a b2evolution style to match rpath.com
* [POSTPONED] Highlight search results in descriptions
* Fix all breadcrumbs
* Rework registration forms to work around mozilla bug #302190
 - Create Account done.  Need work on create project
* Update html <title> on all pages
* When the user changes their email address, it should be re-verified.
  We should send two emails upon change: one to the old with a "cancel this change" link,
  and one to the new with a "confirm this change" link. This will be safe even if the user
  puts a typo into the new email address, and will also be safe if the old email address is
  completely disabled. The only pathological case that it won't cover is if they typo *and*
  their current email address is dead. Human intervention will be needed in that case!
* Add a "project home page" field and edit function (maybe merge into Edit Description)
* Add a check on Cancel Account and prevent the operation if the user is the sole owner of any
  project.
* Add a check to prevent the sole owner of a project from demoting themselves to developer
  or resigning.
* Remove search and browse users.
* Immediately block unconfirmed users and require them to confirm their email or try again.

MISSING FEATURES

* [POSTPONED] Bug tracking
* Upgrade procedure for handling database schema changes
* Metadata editing for packages
* Ability to easily email every the holder of every user account
  (for things like major site changes, privacy notice updates, etc.)
* Each project site should have a sidebar with recently updated packages
  (see http://www.archlinux.org/)
