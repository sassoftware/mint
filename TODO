DATABASE 

* eliminate the Project.getLabel() and [getRepoMap, addLabel, getLabelIds,
  getLabelById] duplication.
* a separate database table for namespaces; maybe not needed; maybe we can use Labels table?
* split project hostname into hostname and domain name

* refactor mint -> imagetool-backend, imagetool (product frontend), mint (public frontend)

TEST SUITE

* test suite improvements
    * be able to test membership levels (trouble is accessing new project's repository by hostname
      which doesn't really exist)
    * check coverage
    * test image creation

JOB SERVER

* improve job-server
    * more robust (handle server restarts, etc0
* cron jobs for mail list handling

USER INTERFACE

* Fixes
    * Fix traceback on package search results page when clicking on package
* Implement "cancel account"
* Make project name on package search results page a link to each project's page
* Implement a few static-text pages: about rpath, ToS, privacy, contact into, products
* [SORT OF DONE] Fix 'most active' and 'most popular' project links
 - We need to parse the Commits table and downloads counter and distill some real
   statistical information to use for these links.
* Fix 'more about rpath' link
* Fix up news handling
 - create a b2evolution style to match rpath.com
* [POSTPONED] Highlight search results in descriptions
* Fix all breadcrumbs
* Rework registration forms to work around mozilla bug #302190
* Update html <title> on all pages
* When the user changes their email address, it should be re-verified.
  We should send two emails upon change: one to the old with a "cancel this change" link,
  and one to the new with a "confirm this change" link. This will be safe even if the user
  puts a typo into the new email address, and will also be safe if the old email address is
  completely disabled. The only pathological case that it won't cover is if they typo *and*
  their current email address is dead. Human intervention will be needed in that case!
* Confirmation changes:
 - Make a separate 'waiting for confirmation' page after registration instead of just using
   login with a message. Also need a separate page to announce confirmation.
 - create a separate RegistrationChallenge table containing userId, age, and confirmation string
   so we don't have to keep the confirm string around in the Users table after confirmation,
   and so we can purge old unconfirmed accounts.
* validate email address on register new user
* improve atomicity of user create process (email fails to send--user is created but left hanging)

MISC

* Split public and private xmlrpc calls out into separate urls and
  use access controls on the web server to limit access instead of
  trying to do it inside the server class.

MISSING FEATURES

* [POSTPONED] Bug tracking
* Upgrade procedure for handling database schema changes
* Metadata editing for packages
* Each project site should have a sidebar wtih recently updated packages
  (see http://www.archlinux.org/)
