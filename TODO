DATABASE 

* eliminate the Project.getLabel() and [getRepoMap, addLabel, getLabelIds,
  getLabelById] duplication.
* a separate database table for namespaces; maybe not needed; maybe we can use Labels table?

* refactor mint -> imagetool-backend, imagetool (product frontend), mint (public frontend)

TEST SUITE

* test suite improvements
    * be able to test membership levels (trouble is accessing new project's repository by hostname
      which doesn't really exist)
    * check coverage
    * test image creation

JOB SERVER

* improve job-server
    * more robust (handle server restarts, etc0
* [DONE needs beta testing] cron jobs for mail list handling

USER INTERFACE

* Implement a few static-text pages: about rpath, contact into, products
* [SORT OF DONE] Fix 'most active' and 'most popular' project links
 - We need to parse the Commits table and downloads counter and distill some real
   statistical information to use for these links.
* Fix 'more about rpath' link
* Fix up news handling
 - create a b2evolution style to match rpath.com
* [POSTPONED] Highlight search results in descriptions
* Fix all breadcrumbs
 - capitalization

MISSING FEATURES

* [POSTPONED] Bug tracking
* Upgrade procedure for handling database schema changes
* Metadata editing for packages
* Ability to easily email every the holder of every user account
  (for things like major site changes, privacy notice updates, etc.)
* Each project site should have a sidebar with recently updated packages
  (see http://www.archlinux.org/)
* Server -> User messaging system
 - we need an in-band way for users to ask to join a project (only one time
   to prevent DoS-style issues with hundreds of join requests), and for
   project owners to offer membership.

PRODUCTIZE

* create a default layout.kid and frontPage.kid
* new make-dist type target
