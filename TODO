* eliminate the Project.getLabel() and [getRepoMap, addLabel, getLabelIds,
  getLabelById] duplication.
* a separate database table for namespaces
* refactor mint -> imagetool-backend, imagetool (product frontend), mint (public frontend)
* test suite improvements
    * be able to test membership levels (trouble is accessing new project's repository by hostname
      which doesn't really exist)
    * check coverage
    * test image creation
* improve job-server
    * more robust (handle server restarts, etc0
    * place cached changesets into a separate directory
      per repo...maybe key on something else like a sha1 of full version, name, and flavor?
      does darby do this anywhere?
