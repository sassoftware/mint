			<description>We have updated the rBuilder Online code to version 1.1.1, which includes the following new features:


Customized Anaconda images are now automatically generated if anaconda-custom does not exist on the project repository:


Group Builder groups can be cooked to x86 and x86_64 targets.
We have improved cross-browser compatibility by porting many of the Javascript operations to the MochiKit Javascript library.


Enjoy!</description>

			<description>If you've been unable to access rBuilder Online earlier today, blame it on that unknown force that causes two inherently-incompatible things to be attracted to each other:


  Freshly-washed motor vehicles and rain

  The buttered side of toast and the floor

  Fiber optic cable and backhoes


Yes, rBuilder Online fell victim to not one, but two errant backhoes backhoe-ing where they shouldn't have.  This caused a network outage on Cogent's backbone that blacked out customers from Tampa to Washington DC.

But now we're back, so be sure to try out our nifty Group Builder, and make the distribution that you want!</description>

			<title>Group Builder Launched!</title>
			<link>http://blogs.conary.com/index.php/rpathcom/2005/11/16/group_builder_launched</link>

			<description>We have updated the rBuilder Online code to version 1.1.0:


A group builder has been implemented. See this blog post for more information.
Many performance improvements to the site and database backend have been made.
Group troves in the repository browser now show contained troves instead of files.
The installable ISO generator now copies everything from /usr/share/anaconda/ in the anaconda-custom trove to the product.img overlay. This makes it possible for experienced anaconda hackers to perform more comprehensive customization of the installation process.


To get started with the new group builder, pick one of your projects, click on Group Builder from the menu on the left, and follow the instructions! As always, we eagerly await your feedback and thoughts!</description>
