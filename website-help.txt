Conary configuration for users (always displayed)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

You have two options available to you if you want to install software from
this project:

    o You can perform an installation by specifying this project's label as
      part of the conary command

    o You can configure Conary to automatically search this project's label
      so that subsequent conary commands need not explicitly specify it

Which option should I choose?

    It really depends on what your long-term expectations are with respect
to this project.

    If this project has only one trove that interests you, specify the
label as part of the conary command.  Note that this does *not* prevent
Conary from accessing this project's repository to find (and install)
updates to the software you install -- Conary takes care of that for you.

    On the other hand, if this project has lots of interesting troves and
you expect that you'll be coming back from time to time to see what
newly-available software there is, you should configure Conary to
automatically search this project's label.

*How do I do it?*

*Specifying This Project's Label as Part of the Conary command*

    Use Conary's --install-label option to specify this project's label
when issuing a conary update command:

conary update --install-label [this project's label] <trove>

(Where <trove> represents the name of the trove to be installed.)

*Configuring Conary to Automatically Search this Project's Label*

    To configure Conary to automatically search this project's label you
must use a text editor to add the label to Conary's main configuration
file, /etc/conaryrc.

    NOTE: You must be the root user (either by logging in as root, or by
using the su command) to edit this file.

    The option you must modify is installLabelPath.  This option contains
the list of labels that Conary searches when performing the initial
installation of a trove.  The order of labels in the list determines
the order in which they will be searched.

    You can display the current installLabelPath setting using the
following command:

conary config | grep installLabelPath

If this project's label is already be included in your system's
installLabelPath, you don't need to make any changes at all -- just install
the desired trove using the "conary update" command shown at the end of
this page.

    However, if this project's label is not currently included in your
system's installLabelPath, you must add it.

    Using the text editor of your choice, open /etc/conaryrc, and find the
installLabelPath line.  At this point, you must decide where in the list to
place this project's label.

    In most cases, you can just add the project's label to the end of the
list (Note: even though it can be quite long, the installLabelPath line
*must* remain one line):

installLabelPath <label1> ... <labelN> [this project's label]

    This approach would not work if one or more labels in the list had
troves with the same names as those in the project's label.  In that case,
this project's label should be inserted before the labels with the
same-named troves:

installLabelPath [this project's label] <label1> ... <labelN>

    Once you've added the project's label, the Conary command you'll use to
install trove's from the project's repository takes the form:

conary update <trove>

(Where <trove> represents the name of the trove to be installed.)
