*Welcome to rPath*

Welcome to rPath.org -- the site for collaborative open source development.

On this site, developers can create and host projects and operating
systems, while users can browse and download projects and operating system
images for installation.

rPath's mission is to provide system software that is easily tailored to
suit unique application needs.

As part of that mission, we've deployed our tools and technologies on
rPath.com, for you to use.  Of course, how you'll use rPath.com depends on
who you are.

If coding is your thing, you can use rPath.com to host your open source
development project. (Not quite ready to share your work with the world?
No problem; rPath can still help -- go [here] (link to corporate site) to
find out how.)

What's a project?  It can be anything from packaging an app so it'll be
available for use on Conary-based systems, to the creation of an operating
system environment tailored for a specific purpose.

What do you get?  Here's the list:

    o A Conary repository dedicated to your project

    o A project-specific hostname (<project-name>.rpath.org)

    o Project-specific mailing lists:

        - <project-name>@rpath.org
        - <project-name>-commits@rpath.org
        - <project-name>-devel@rpath.org (if desired)
        - <project-name>-bugs@rpath.org (if desired)

    o A no-frills project-specific page (http://<project-name>.rpath.org/)

    o The ability to create "releases" (downloadable images in a variety of
      formats) with a single mouse click

    o A project membership framework that allows you to keep track of your
      project's members (people able to commit changes to your project's
      repository) and owners (people that can manage project membership as
      well as having commit access)

How much does it cost?  Nothing -- rPath.com's services are free for any
open source project.

Not the project creating type?  If you see an interesting project, offer
your services to the project's owners.  If they accept, they'll make you a
member of the project, and you'll be able to start contributing
immediately.

HOW DO I GET STARTED?

First, you need to create your own rPath.com account.

To do this, click on the [new account] (link to new account page) link at
the top right-hand side of the rPath.com homepage.  You'll be taken to a
form to fill out.  At a minimum you must fill in the following fields:

    o Username -- Limit to no more than 16 characters

    o Email Address -- This email address is strictly for rPath to contact
      you regarding rPath.com

    o New Password -- The password you'll use to login to your account
      (must be at least 6 characters)

    o Confirm Password -- Confirmation of the password you entered above.

Even though it is not required, you should strongly consider filling in the
"Contact Information" field.  Why?  Well, if you are going to create a
project and you're looking for people to join, they'll be using the
contents of this field to contact you.  (Note that whatever you enter here
will be publicly accessible, so you should use notation such as "name at
example dot com" to make life difficult for spammers.)

Finally, you must check the two checkboxes entitled "I have read and accept
the Terms of Service" and "I have read and accept the Privacy Policy".

Click on "Register", and you will receive an email (sent to the email
address you entered) with a confirmation link.  Use your brower to follow
the link, and you'll then be able to login.

Creating a New Project

If you'd like to create a new project, start the project creation process
by clicking on the "Create a new project" link.  After that, the process is
no more complex than filling in a few text fields and clicking on a
"Create" button.

Joining an Existing Project

If you're interested in joining an already-existing project, go to the
project's homepage, click on the "project members" link, and click on one
of the project owners to get their contact information.  When you contact
the project owner, ask them to make you a project member, and include your
rPath.com username (they'll need it to make you a project member).

Even if you're not the coding type, rPath.com still has a lot to offer.

Already using a Conary-based system?  You came to the right place to look
for software -- browse and search your way to the right package, and then
use Conary to install it right off the project's repository.

Looking for a Conary-based system?  Search and/or browse the projects on
rPath.com, and pick the one that best meets your needs.  Download the
release, and you're off and running.

Interested in a particular project?  You can keep track of what's going on
by subscribing to the project's mailing list(s), or just use the project's
"recent releases" RSS feed to find out when there's a new release
available.

HOW DO I GET STARTED?

Use rPath.com's browse and search functions to learn more about the
projects and software available.

Found an interesting project?  Here are some helpful hints:

    o The project's home page contains the necessary Conary configuration
      information to install the project's software on your Conary-based
      system.

    o You can keep in touch with the project by following developer
      discussion and code commits using the project's mailing lists.

    o The project's release page lists all available releases (which --
      depending on the project -- can be installable or live-boot ISO
      images, among others).

newly-created account.)

Congratulations!  Your new account is active!

It's time to take the next step -- but what that step is depends on you:

    o You can join an existing project

    o You can create a new project

Let's go through each in more detail.

Joining a Project

If you're interested in joining a project, you probably already have a
project in mind (if not, browse through the available projects, and make
your selection).  Go to the project's homepage, and click on "project
members" link.  Under the "project owners" heading, you'll find the
owner(s) of the project.  Click on a name, and use their contact
information to request membership in their project.

Creating a Project

To create a project, click on the "Create a new project" link under the "My
Projects" sidebar on the rPath.com homepage.  You'll be taken to a form to
fill out.  At a minimum you must fill in the following fields:

    o Project Name -- (alphanumeric only, 16 characters maximum)

    o Project Title -- A longer, more descriptive name for your
      project. Eg., My Custom Linux Project Home Page


Optional:

    o Project Home Page -- 

    o Project Description -- 

    o Additional Mailing Lists -- projectname-devel   projectname-bugs
