*Welcome to rPath*

Welcome to rPath.org -- the site for collaborative open source development.

On this site, developers can create and host projects and operating
systems, while users can browse and download projects and operating system
images for installation.

rPath's mission is to *** blah blah blah ***

As part of that mission, we've deployed our tools and technologies on
rPath.com, for you to use.  Of course, how you'll use rPath.com depends on
who you are.

*I'm a Developer* (Should this be a link to a developer help page with the
 following content?)

If coding is your thing, you can use rPath to host your open source
development project. (Not quite ready to share your work with the world?
No problem; rPath can still help -- go [here] (link to corporate site) to
find out how.)

What's a project?  It can be anything from packaging an app so it'll be
available to Conary-based systems, to the creation of an operating system
environment tailored for a specific purpose.

What do you get?  Here's the list:

    o A Conary repository dedicated to your project

    o A project-specific hostname (<project-name>.rpath.org)

    o Project-specific mailing lists:

        - <project-name>@rpath.org
        - <project-name>-commits@rpath.org
        - <project-name>-devel@rpath.org (if desired)
        - <project-name>-bugs@rpath.org (if desired)

    o A no-frills project-specific page (http://<project-name>.rpath.org/)

    o The ability to create "releases" (downloadable images in a variety of
      formats) with a single mouse click

    o A project membership framework that allows you to keep track of your
      project's members (people able to commit changes to your project's
      repository) and owners (people that can manage project membership as
      well as having commit access)

How much does it cost?  Nothing -- rPath.com's services are free for any
open source project.

Not the project creating type?  If you see an interesting project, offer
your services to the project's owners.  If they accept, they'll make you a
member of the project, and you'll be able to start contributing
immediately.

HOW DO I GET STARTED?  First, register for an rPath.com account.  Once
you've gotten the confirmation email and have logged in, you can get
started.

If you'd like to create a new project, start the project creation process
by clicking on the "Create a new project" link.  After that, the process is
no more complex than filling in a few text fields reviewing our terms of
service and privacy policy, and clicking on a "submit" button.

If you're interested in joining an already-existing project, go to the
project's homepage, click on the "project members" link, and click on one
of the project owners to get their contact information.  When you contact
the project owner, ask them to make you a project member, and include your
rPath.com username (they'll need it to make you a project member).

*But I'm Not a Developer* (Should this be a link to a non-developer help
 page with the following content?)

Even if you're not the type to work late into the night getting your latest
creation to build, rPath.com still has a lot to offer.

Already using a Conary-based system?  You came to the right place to look
for software -- browse and search your way to the right package, and then
use Conary to install it right off the project's repository.

Looking for a Conary-based system?  Search and/or browse the projects on
rPath.com, and pick the one that best meets your needs.  Download the
release, and you're off and running.

Interested in a particular project?  You can keep track of what's going on
by subscribing to the project's mailing list(s), or just use the project's
"recent releases" RSS feed to find out when there's a new release
available.

HOW DO I GET STARTED?  Use rPath.com's browse and search functions to learn
more about the projects and software available -- it's that simple.
