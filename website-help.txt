Conary configuration for users (always displayed)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Current text:

To add this project in your Conary configuration, add
frobnitz.beta.rpath.com@rpl:devel to the installLabelPath line in the
/etc/conaryrc (or your ~/.conaryrc) file.

New text:

You have two options available to you if you want to install software from
this project:

    o You can perform an installation by manually specifying the install
      label

    o You can configure Conary to automatically search the install label

Which option should I choose?

    It really depends on what your long-term expectations are with respect
to this project.

    If the project has only one package that interests you, manually
specify the install label.  Note that this does *not* prevent Conary from
accessing this project's repository from finding (and installing) updates
to the software you install -- Conary takes care of that for you.

    On the other hand, if the project has lots of interesting packages and
you expect that you'll be coming back from time to time to see what
newly-available software there is, you should configure Conary to
automatically search this project's label.

How do I do it?

*Manually Specifying the Project's label*

Use Conary's --install-label option to specify this project's when issuing
a conary update command:

conary update --install-label frobnitz.beta.rpath.com@rpl:devel <package>

(Where <package> represents the name of the package to be installed.)

*Configuring Conary to Automatically Search the Install Label*

***FIXME***
