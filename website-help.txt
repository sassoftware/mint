*** FIXME -- add generic pointer to Conary docs; cdtd? ***

You have two options available to you if you want to install software from
this project:

    o You can perform an installation by specifying this project's label as
      part of the conary command

    o You can configure Conary to automatically search this project's label
      so that subsequent conary commands need not explicitly specify it

Which option should I choose?

    It really depends on what your long-term expectations are with respect
to this project.

    If this project has only one trove that interests you, specify the
label as part of the conary command.  Note that this does *not* prevent
Conary from accessing this project's repository to find (and install)
updates to the software you install -- Conary takes care of that for you.

    On the other hand, if this project has lots of interesting troves and
you expect that you'll be coming back from time to time to see what
newly-available software there is, you should configure Conary to
automatically search this project's label.

*How do I do it?*

*Specifying This Project's Label as Part of the Conary command*

    Use the following command format to specify this project's label when
issuing a conary update command:

conary update <trove>=[this project's label]

(Where <trove> represents the name of the trove to be installed.)

*Configuring Conary to Automatically Search this Project's Label*

    To configure Conary to automatically search this project's label you
must use a text editor to add the label to Conary's main configuration
file, /etc/conaryrc.

    NOTE: You must be the root user (either by logging in as root, or by
using the su command) to edit this file.

    The option you must modify is installLabelPath.  This option contains
the list of labels that Conary searches when performing the initial
installation of a trove.  The order of labels in the list determines
the order in which they will be searched.

    You can display the current installLabelPath setting using the
following command:

conary config | grep installLabelPath

If this project's label is already be included in your system's
installLabelPath, you don't need to make any changes at all -- just install
the desired trove using the "conary update" command shown at the end of
this page.

    However, if this project's label is not currently included in your
system's installLabelPath, you must add it.

    Using the text editor of your choice, open /etc/conaryrc, and find the
installLabelPath line.  At this point, you must decide where in the list to
place this project's label.

    In most cases, you can just add the project's label to the end of the
list (Note: Even though it can be quite long, the list *must* remain on one
line):

installLabelPath <label1> ... <labelN> [this project's label]

    This approach would not work if one or more labels in the list had
troves with the same names as those in the project's label.  In that case,
this project's label should be inserted before the labels with the
same-named troves:

installLabelPath [this project's label] <label1> ... <labelN>

    Once you've added the project's label, the Conary command you'll use to
install trove's from the project's repository takes the form:

conary update <trove>

(Where <trove> represents the name of the trove to be installed.)

* Short version
** Display the project's label

If you've already packaged using Conary, the only information you need is
the project's buildLabel:

[this project's label]

And the URL for the project's repositoryMap:

[this project's repo url with <username>:<password> embedded]

Note that you must replace <username> and <password> with your rBuilder
Online username and password, respectively.

* Long version -- Setting up a Conary build environment
** (Many ways of doing it; this is one possible approach)

If you're new to packaging with Conary, you need to create some directories
and Conary configuration files; there are many different ways to do this,
but the following approach works for single or multiple projects.

** Creating Directories
*** Create a repo-specific directory
**** Create ./src
**** Create ./builds
**** Create ./cache

First, you must create a directory tree that will contain all your
packaging related to this project.  The name of the root directory for this
tree should clearly identify the project; some people use the hostname of
the project's repository ([repo hostname]), while others use just the
project's name ([project name]) -- the choice is yours.

(Note: If you anticipate packaging software for more than just this
projects, you should consider making this project's directory tree a
subdirectory of another directory (conary, for example).  This way, all
your Conary packaging work will be in one place.)

Once you've decided on a name for this project's directory, create it and
populate it with the following subdirectories:

    o src
    o builds
    o cache

** Setting up conaryrc files
*** /etc/conaryrc
**** System-wide stuff, best not used to contain build-related settings

Next, it's time to set up Conary's configuration files.  The first one to
consider is /etc/conaryrc -- this file should contain only system-wide
settings; no settings related to packaging should be here.

*** $HOME/.conaryrc
**** Stuff specific to the developer, like:
***** name
***** contact (may need to be repo-specific depending on the project)

Create a file called .conaryrc in your home directory.  This file should
contain Conary settings that are specific to you, such as:

    o name
    o contact

*** ./conaryrc
**** Stuff specific to the repository, like:
***** buildLabel
***** buildPath
***** lookaside
***** repositoryMap (includes username/passwd for repo access -- https!)

Finally, create a file called conaryrc (note the absence of a dot) in your
project's root directory.  This file should contain Conary settings that
are exclusively related to this project, such as:

    o buildLabel ([this project's label])
    o buildPath (full path to the builds subdirectory)
    o lookaside (full path to the cache subdirectory)
    o repositoryMap ([this project's repo URL with <username>:<password> embedded]

**** In ./src, symlink ./conary to ../conaryrc
**** After after each "cvc newpkg" symlink ./conaryrc to ../../conaryrc

Because Conary only reads the conaryrc file when it is in the current
directory, you need to create a symlink for it in the src subdirectory.
This way, when you issue a "cvc newpkg" command in the src subdirectory,
Conary will be configured properly.

Note also that, whenever you issue a "cvc newpkg" command, you should then
create a symlink to ../../conaryrc in the newly-created directory.  This
way future Conary commands in that directory will work as expected.

** Using PGP keys
*** Uploading your public key
*** Configuring Conary to use your key
**** signatureKey (may by developer- or repo-specific depending on project)

Conary includes support for signed packages using OpenPGP keys.  To make
use of this feature, you must first upload your public key to this
project's repository.  This can be done by either clicking on the "upload a
package signing key" link present below your username in the upper
right-hand corner of the page, or
