"""This module contains your site-specific settings.

From a brand new distribution it should be copied to mm_cfg.py.  If you
already have an mm_cfg.py, be careful to add in only the new settings you
want.  Mailman's installation procedure will never overwrite your mm_cfg.py
file.

The complete set of distributed defaults, with documentation, are in the file
Defaults.py.  In mm_cfg.py, override only those you want to change, after the

  from Defaults import *

line (see below).

Note that these are just default settings; many can be overridden via the
administrator and user interfaces on a per-list or per-user basis.

#    Set URL and email domain names                          #
# 
# Mailman needs to know about (at least) two fully-qualified domain
# names (fqdn)
#
# 1) the hostname used in your urls (DEFAULT_URL_HOST)
# 2) the hostname used in email addresses for your domain (DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST)
#
# For example, if people visit your Mailman system with
# "http://www.dom.ain/mailman" then your url fqdn is "www.dom.ain",
# and if people send mail to your system via "yourlist@dom.ain" then
# your email fqdn is "dom.ain".  DEFAULT_URL_HOST controls the former,
# and DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST controls the latter.  Mailman also needs to
# know how to map from one to the other (this is especially important
# if you're running with virtual domains).  You use
# "add_virtualhost(urlfqdn, emailfqdn)" to add new mappings.

# Default to using the FQDN of machine mailman is running on.
# If this is not correct for your installation delete the following 5
# lines that acquire the FQDN and manually edit the hosts instead.
