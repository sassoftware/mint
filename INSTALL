rBuilder Appliance Installation Quick Start Guide

    This document describes the steps necessary to install the rBuilder
software appliance on the hardware you've provided.

Prerequisites
-------------

    Before you begin, make sure you have the necessary hardware and network
connectivity in place, namely:

    o A network-connected dedicated x86 server with local storage at
      least 40GB in size, a CD-ROM drive, configured to boot from CD-ROM

      NOTE: rBuilder is packaged as a software appliance.  As such, it is
      configured to run on dedicated hardware, including all disk storage.
      DO NOT INSTALL ON HARDWARE CONTAINING DATA YOU WISH TO KEEP -- IT
      WILL WIPE ALL LOCAL STORAGE!

*** FIXME -- Should discuss wildcard DNS issues? ***

    o A network connection for the server with either a static or dynamic
      IP address accessible by an unchanging fully-qualified domain name
      (for example, rbuilder.example.com)

      NOTE: rPath recommends that the server be set up to receive a
      DHCP-provided hostname and IP address before installation.

*** END FIXME ***

    o A network-connected system capable of running a Web browser

Installation Procedure
------------ ---------

1. Insert the rPath rBuilder Appliance CD-ROM into the server's CD-ROM
   drive and boot the computer. The installer will erase ALL partitions on
   the server. You will be prompted before this happens.

2. Follow the on-screen instructions during the installation.

    NOTE: During installation, you can choose to automatically or manually
    partition the system.  If you automatically partition the system, ***
    FIXME -- Describe how the system is partitioned ***; if you manually
    partition the system, make sure you have sufficient storage allocated
    to /srv/, as the rBuilder Appliance stores all its data there.

3. When the installation finishes, reboot (making sure to configure the
   system to boot from its primary disk drive).

4. When the server has finished booting, use a Web browser to access the
   server.  Use a URL in the form "http://rbuilder.example.com/", replacing
   "rbuilder.example.com" with the fully-qualified domain name specified
   for the server.

   NOTE: you MUST use the fully-qualified domain name to access the server!

5. Next, the rBuilder Appliance configuration dialog appears.  Fill in the
   fields in the "Branding" section with values that are appropriate to
   your organization.  The fields in the "Server Setup" section contain
   values for hostname and domain extracted from the rBuilder Appliance's
   network configuration; change them if necessary.

   The field in the "Repository Setup" section should be set to a value
   appropriate for your intended Conary usage.  For example, the rPath
   Linux development branch is "rpl:devel", while the rPath Linux 1 branch
   is "rpl:1".  rPath strongly recommends entering "rpl:1".

   Finally, fill in the fields in the "Initial Administrator Account"
   section.  An account with this information will be created that will
   have complete access to the rBuilder Appliance environment.

6. Click on the "Save Changes" button to save your configuration.

7. Once the configuration process is complete, a new page will be
   displayed.  Click on the "Launch" button to start the rBuilder
   Appliance, making it available to your users.  After a short delay you
   will be directed to the main rBuilder Appliance home page.

8. Log in using the username and password you specified for in the
   configuration dialog's "Initial Administrator Account" section. Click on
   the "Site Administration" link at the bottom of the orange box on the
   right.

9. In the "Administration Menu" page, you'll find a link entitled "Add
   Externally-Managed Project".  Click on it.

10. The "Add External Project" page will then appear.  The fields will be
    pre-populated to add rPath Linux as an external project, which is
    necessary if your organization plans to use rPath Linux as the basis
    for the software appliances it develops.

    NOTE: You have the option of creating a local mirror of the rPath Linux
    repository.  Clicking on the "Mirror this repository locally" checkbox
    will result in a copy of the rPath Linux repository (specifically that
    part of the repository represented by the contents of the "Project
    Label" field) being created on your rBuilder Appliance.  Doing this
    requires a significant commitment of disk space; currently, this takes
    *** FIXME -- get size estimate ***.

    If you decide to locally mirror the rPath Linux repository, you have
    the option of starting the "preloading" the mirror from rPath-supplied
    media.  If you have this media available, check the "Preload this
    mirror with a set of CDs or DVDs" checkbox.  You must also enter
    appropriate authentication information (either in the form of a
    username and password, or an entitlement).  *** FIXME -- This interface
    is going to change ***

12: You will then be directed to your rBuilder Appliance's local rPath
    Linux project page.  Note that you are listed as a project owner;
    however, given that the rPath Linux project is external, some links
    (such as Group Builder) are not fully functional, given the read-only
    nature of the rPath Linux repository.

    NOTE: The rPath Linux repository will not be fully integrated into your
    rBuilder Appliance's environment immediately; however, functions such
    as package search will work within the hour, as the local repository
    index is populated.

*** FIXME -- revamp to address the centralized conaryrc support, and
    entering a "non-standard" label for the project's repository ***

13. You can now create a new project by clicking on the "Create a new
    project" link and following the instructions. Take special note of the
    "Project Name" fields -- the values you use here have long-term
    implications for the eventual deployment of software developed in this
    project.  The "learn more" link has additional details.

Text Editor
---- ------

The nano text editor has been added to rBuilder Appliance.  In normal
circumstances it should not be necessary to directly edit files (all normal
configuration is done via the Web-based administrative interface), but
should the need arise the editor can be launched by entering the "nano"
command.
