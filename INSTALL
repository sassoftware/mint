rBuilder Installation Quick Start Guide

    This document describes the steps necessary to install the rBuilder
software appliance on the hardware you've provided.

Prerequisites
-------------

    Before you begin, make sure you have the necessary hardware and network
connectivity in place, namely:

    o A network-connected dedicated x86 server with local storage at
      least 40GB in size, a CD-ROM drive, configured to boot from CD-ROM

      NOTE: rBuilder is packaged as a software appliance.  As such, it is
      configured to run on dedicated hardware, including all disk storage.
      DO NOT INSTALL ON HARDWARE CONTAINING DATA YOU WISH TO KEEP -- IT
      WILL WIPE ALL LOCAL STORAGE!

    o A network connection for the server with either a static or dynamic
      IP address accessible by an unchanging fully-qualified domain name
      (for example, rbuilder.example.com)

      NOTE: rPath recommends that the server be set up to receive a
      DHCP-provided hostname and IP address before installation.

    o A network-connected system capable of running a Web browser

Installation Procedure
------------ ---------

1. Insert the rPath rBuilder CD-ROM into the server's CD-ROM drive and boot
   the computer. The installer will erase ALL partitions on the server. You
   will be prompted before this happens.

2. Follow the on-screen instructions during the installation.

3. When the installation finishes, reboot (making sure to configure the
   system to boot from its primary disk drive).

4. When the server has finished booting, use a Web browser to access the
   server.  Use a URL in the form "http://rbuilder.example.com", replacing
   "rbuilder.example.com" with the fully-qualified domain name specified
   for the server.

   NOTE: you MUST use the fully-qualified domain name to access the server!

5. The server will display a page directing you to log into the rBuilder
   server via ssh as root and create a file on the filesystem.  This
   verifies that you have physical access to the server and are the person
   that will be given access to rBuilder Web-based configuration dialog.
   Follow the instructions on the screen, and reload the web page.

6. After the page reloads, the rBuilder configuration dialog appears.  Fill
   in the fields in the "Branding" section with values that are appropriate
   to your organization.  The fields in the "Server Setup" section contain
   values for hostname and domain extracted from the rBuilder server's
   network configuration; change them if necessary.

   The field in the "Repository Setup" section should be set to a value
   appropriate for your intended Conary usage.  For example, the rPath
   Linux development branch is "rpl:devel", while the rPath Linux 1 branch
   is "rpl:1"

   Finally, fill in the fields in the "Initial Administrator Account"
   section.  And account with this information will be created that will
   have complete access to the rBuilder environment.

7. Click on the "Save Changes" button to save your configuration.

8. Once the configuration process is complete, a new page will be
   displayed.  Click on the "Launch" button to start rBuilder, making it
   available to your users.  After a short delay you will be directed to
   the main rBuilder home page.

8. Log in using the username and password you specified for in the
configuration dialog's "Initial Administrator Account" section. Click on
the "Administer rBuilder" link at the bottom of the orange box on the right
(You may have to scroll that box).

9. On the "Available operations" page, you'll find a link entitled "Add
   External Project".  Click on it.

10. The "Add External Project" page will then appear.  The fields will be
    pre-populated to add rPath Linux as an external project, which is
    necessary if your organization plans to use rPath Linux as the basis
    for the software appliances it develops.  Click on the "Create" button.

11: You will then be directed to your rBuilder server's local rPath Linux
    project page.  Note that you are listed as a project owner; however,
    given that the rPath Linux project is external, some links (such as
    Group Builder) are not fully functional, given the read-only nature of
    the rPath Linux repository.

    NOTE: The rPath Linux repository will not be fully integrated into your
    rBuilder server's environment immediately; however, functions such as
    package search will work within the hour, as the local repository index
    is populated.

12. You can now create a new rBuilder project by clicking on the "Create a
    new project" link and following the instructions. Once your project has
    been created, the project's repository will be accessible using this
    configuration line in your conaryrc file:

repositoryMap <proj>.example.com http://rbuilder.example.com/repos/<proj>/

(Where "<proj>" is your project's name, and "rbuilder" and "example.com"
are your server's hostname and domain name, respectively.)
