        ("Effective Date") by and between rPath, Inc. (&#8220;rPath&#8221;) and you,
        hereinafter referred to as &#8220;you&#8221; or &#8220;your&#8221;.</p>

        <h3>DEFINITIONS</h3>

        <p>&#8220;Web Site&#8221; means the rpath.com and rpath.org domains.</p>

        <p>&#8220;Content&#8221; means all information and materials, regardless of
        format.</p>

        <p>&#8220;rPath Repository&#8221; is the software database that is hosted on
        the Web Site.</p>

        <p>&#8220;rBuilder Online&#8221; means the software, owned by rPath, that
        provides the primary functionality of the Web Site.</p>

        <p>&#8220;Service&#8221; means the processes and functionality provided by
        rBuilder Online, the rPath Repository and the Web Site.</p>

        <h3>1. RIGHT OF USE</h3>

        <p>rPath grants to you the rights herein, provided that you accept,
        without modification, the terms and conditions set forth in this
        Agreement and that you are in compliance with the terms and
        conditions of this Agreement.</p>

        <p>rPath grants to you a personal, non-exclusive, world-wide and
        non-transferable license to rBuilder Online as a tool to build
        software using only Content from the rPath Repository.  Any use of
        rBuilder Online with Content from any source other than the rPath
        Repository is a material breach of this Agreement.  Portions of
        rBuilder Online may be downloaded, stored and executed on your
        systems.  You own the media and the hardware on which rBuilder
        Online is stored and executed but rPath retains ownership of the
        rBuilder Online software itself.</p>

        <p>rPath also grants to you the right to use the Services to upload
        software into the rPath Repository, to download software from the
        rPath Repository, and to access Content on the Web Site in
        conjunction with the Services.</p>

        <p>You agree not to resell any of the Services.</p>

        <h3>2. REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS</h3>

        <p>You must provide true, accurate, current and complete
        information in the registration process on the Web Site
        (collectively, the "Registration Information") and must maintain
        and promptly update the Registration Information as necessary.
        rPath reserves the right to terminate this Agreement and to
        prohibit any and all current or future use by you of the Services,
        if rPath has reasonable grounds to suspect that your Registration
        Information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete.  You
        grant to rPath the right to use your Registration Information in
        connection with Content that you upload, post, email, transmit or
        store using the Services.</p>

        <p>For more information on how rPath uses your personal
        information, consult the privacy policy at: <a href="${cfg.basePath}/legal?page=privacy">http://${siteHost}${cfg.basePath}/legal?page=privacy</a></p>

        <p>You will receive a User ID and password (collectively, the &#8220;User
        ID&#8221;) upon completing the registration process on the Web Site.  You
        are solely responsible for the use of your User ID, whether or not
        such use is authorized by you, and for maintaining the
        confidentiality of your User ID.  You shall immediately notify
        rPath of any unauthorized use of your User ID.  rPath shall not be
        liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply
        with this Section.</p>

        <h3>3. CONTENT</h3>

        <p>Whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, all Content on
        the Web Site and all Content contained in the rPath Repository that
        originated from users of the Services is the sole responsibility of
        the person from which such Content originated. You are responsible
        for all Content that you upload, post, email, transmit or store
        using the Services.  You shall not upload, post, email, transmit or
        store Content or conduct or participate in any activities using the
        Services which, in the judgment of rPath, are likely to be
        prohibited by law in any applicable jurisdiction, including laws
        governing the encryption of software, the export of technology, the
        transmission of obscenity or the permissible uses of intellectual
        property.</p>

        <p>The purpose of the Services is to provide a repository of
        software and corresponding tools to facilitate the sharing and
        development of software (the &#8220;Purpose&#8221;).  rPath will not pre-screen
        or review Content, but rPath reserves the right to refuse or delete
        any Content, of which it becomes aware, that it reasonably deems
        not to fulfill the Purpose.  In addition, rPath shall have the
        right, but not the obligation, in its sole discretion to refuse or
        delete any Content that it reasonably considers to violate the
        terms and conditions of this Agreement or be otherwise illegal.</p>

        <p>rPath, in its sole and absolute discretion, may preserve Content
        and may also disclose Content if required to do so by law or
        judicial or governmental mandate or as reasonably determined useful
        by rPath to protect the rights, property or personal safety of
        rPath, users of the Services, or the public. rPath does not control
        the Content posted via the Services and, as such, does not
        guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content. Under
        no circumstances will rPath be liable in any way for any Content,
        including, but not limited to, liability for any errors or
        omissions in any Content or for any loss or damage of any kind
        incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed or
        otherwise transmitted via the Services.</p>

        <p>By using the Services, you may be exposed to Content that is
        offensive, indecent or objectionable. You must evaluate, and bear
        all risks associated with, the use of any Content, including any
        reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such
        Content.</p>

        <h3>4. LICENSES AND IDEA SUBMISSIONS</h3>

        <p>You agree to grant to rPath a non-exclusive, royalty-free,
        worldwide, perpetual license, with the right to sub-license,
        reproduce, distribute, transmit, create derivative works of,
        publicly display and publicly perform any materials and other
        information you submit via the Services or transmit to rPath,
        including, without limitation, ideas contained therein for new or
        improved products and services.  You agree that you shall have no
        recourse against rPath for any alleged or actual infringement or
        misappropriation of any proprietary right in your submitted
        materials or other information.</p>

        <p>The Contents of the Services are protected by international
        copyright and trademark laws. The owner of the copyrights and
        trademarks are rPath, its affiliates or other third party
        licensors.  Publications, products, content or services referenced

        <h3>6. CHANGES TO THIS AGREEMENT</h3>

        <p>rPath reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change,
        modify, add or remove portions of this Agreement periodically. Such
        modifications shall be effective immediately upon posting of the
        modified Agreement to the Web Site. Your continued use of the
        Services following the posting of changes to this Agreement will
        mean that you accept those changes.</p>

        <p>rPath reserves the right at any time and from time to time to
        modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services, or
        any part thereof. rPath shall not be liable to you or any other
        third party for any such modification, suspension or discontinuance
        except as expressly provided herein.</p>

        <h3>7. CONFIDENTIALITY</h3>

        <p>You agree to maintain the confidentiality of any information
        provided to you by rPath that is marked or otherwise identified as
        confidential or proprietary (&#8220;rPath Proprietary Information&#8221;).
        Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to convey any title or
        ownership rights to the rPath Proprietary Information to you.</p>

        <p>The provisions of this section shall remain in full force and
        effect despite termination of this Agreement for whatever
        reason.</p>

        use the Services, or any of the Content obtained from the Services,
        for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by this
        Agreement. If you violate any of the terms and conditions of this
        Agreement, your permission to use the Services automatically
        terminates.</p>

        <h3>9. TERM AND TERMINATION</h3>

        <p>This Agreement shall continue in force perpetually unless
        terminated by rPath.  Cause for termination shall include, but not
        be limited to, (a) breaches of any material provision of this
        Agreement, (b) a request for termination by you, (c) discontinuance
        or modification of the Services or any part thereof, (d) extended
        periods of inactivity, and/or (e) automatic termination as set
        forth herein.  Upon termination for any reason, your right to
        access, use and/or possess the Services shall immediately cease.
        You shall immediately stop using the Services and shall destroy all
        copies of the rBuilder Online software possessed by you.</p>

        <h3>10. INDEMNIFICATION</h3>

        <p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold rPath harmless against
        any losses, expenses, costs or damages; including rPath reasonable
        attorneys' fees, experts' fees and other reasonable costs of
        litigation; arising from, incurred as a result of, or in any manner
        related to (1) your breach of the terms of this Agreement, (2) your
        unauthorized or unlawful use of the Services, and (3) the
        unauthorized or unlawful use of the Services by any other person
        using your UserID.</p>

        <h3>11. WARRANTIES</h3>

        <p>THE CONTENT AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN "AS IS," AS
        AVAILABLE BASIS. RPATH PROVIDES THE CONTENT AND SERVICES WITHOUT
        WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
        LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
        NONINFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR WARRANTIES
        OF QUALITY OR PERFORMANCE. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN ADVICE OR INFORMATION
        GIVEN BY RPATH, ITS EMPLOYEES, LICENSEES OR THE LIKE WILL CREATE A
        WARRANTY OR GUARANTY; NOR MAY YOU RELY ON ANY SUCH INFORMATION OR
        ADVICE.</p>

        <p>RPATH DOES NOT GUARANTEE CONTINUOUS UNINTERRUPTED OR SECURE
        ACCESS TO THE WEB SITE OR SERVICES. OPERATION OF THE WEB SITE OR
        SERVICES MAY BE SUBJECT TO INTERFERENCE FROM NUMEROUS FACTORS
        OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL. FURTHER, SCHEDULED AND PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE
        AS WELL AS REQUIRED AND EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE WORK MAY TEMPORARILY
        INTERRUPT SERVICES OR ACCESS TO THE WEB SITE.</p>

        <h3>12. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY</h3>

        <p>You understand that rPath cannot and does not guarantee or
        warrant that Content available via the Services will be free from
        infection by viruses, worms, Trojan horses or other code that
        manifest contaminating or destructive properties. You are
        responsible for implementing sufficient procedures and checkpoints
        to satisfy your particular requirements for accuracy of data input
        and output, and for maintaining a means external to the Services
        for the reconstruction of any lost data.</p>

        <p>YOU AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR USE OF THE CONTENT AND
        SERVICES IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
        APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL RPATH BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY
        THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE
        DAMAGES, WHETHER IN TORT OR IN CONTRACT, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS,
        LOST SAVINGS OR OTHER INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF
        RPATH HAS BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.  RPATH'S
        LIABILITY HEREUNDER SHALL NOT EXCEED, IN THE AGGREGATE, THE FEES
        PAID BY YOU FOR THE SPECIFIC CONTENT OR SERVICES WHICH GAVE RISE TO
        SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

        <h3>13. MISCELLANEOUS</h3>

        <p>You may not assign this Agreement or any license granted or
        created hereunder.  rPath may assign this Agreement to a successor
        as the result of an acquisition, merger or other such change of
        control either in whole or in part of rPath's business.</p>

        <p>The parties are independent contractors and nothing in this
        Agreement shall be deemed to make either party an agent, employee,
        partner or joint venturer of the other party.  Neither party shall
        have the authority to bind, commit, or otherwise obligate the other
        party in any manner whatsoever.</p>

        <p>The failure of rPath to require your performance of any
        provision hereof shall not affect the full right to require such
        performance at any time thereafter; nor shall the waiver by rPath
        of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver
        of the provision itself. In the event that any provision of this
        Agreement shall be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable
        law or be so held by applicable court decision, such
        unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement
        unenforceable or invalid as a whole. rPath will amend or replace
        such provision with one that is valid and enforceable and which
        achieves, to the extent possible, the original objectives and
        intent of rPath as reflected in the original provision</p>

        <p>Definitions set forth in any part of this Agreement shall apply
        to all parts of this Agreement.</p>

        <p>The obligations of the parties under this Agreement, which by
        their nature would continue beyond the termination, cancellation or
        expiration of this Agreement, shall survive termination,
        cancellation, or expiration of this Agreement.</p>

        <p>Neither party shall be considered in default in performance of
        its obligations hereunder if performance of such obligations is
        prevented or delayed by force majeure or any cause beyond its
        reasonable control.</p>

        <p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the
        parties regarding the subject matter hereof and supersede all
        proposals and prior discussions and writings between the parties
        with respect thereto.</p>

        <p>This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in
        accordance with the laws of the United States and State of North
        Carolina, excluding its choice of law rules.</p>
