        <h2>rpath.org privacy policy</h2>

        <p>Preface:  We intend this policy to be a common-sense policy
        supporting minimal use and storage of private information.  Our goal
        for this site is to store as little private personal information
        as is technically and legally feasible.</p>

        <p>The term "The Service" as used in this document means the Conary
        repository hosting service accessible via
        <a href="${cfg.basePath}">http://${siteHost}${cfg.basePath}</a> and
        all software development projects created via
        <a href="${cfg.basePath}">http://${siteHost}${cfg.basePath}</a>,
        hosted in the rpath.org domain.</p>

        <p>We will never sell, rent, or otherwise transfer your private
        information that you give to us unless required by law or
        regulation; we will not use your information for unsolicited
        commercial email without your express permission (opt-in);
        you may request to be removed from our lists and we will use
        our best efforts to honor your request within 30 days.</p>

        <p>We may send you automated email messages that are not unsolicited
        commercial email.  By way of example and not limitation:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>We may send periodic emails purely to verify that the email
            data that you have provided to us is still valid.</li>

            <li>We may, from time to time, inform you of any changes to this
            privacy policy or our terms of service by email.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Private information may include the following information in your
        user profile:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>email address</li>
            <li>full name</li>
            <li>passwords and other authentication information such as hints</li>
            <li>other contact information, such as phone number and address</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You may be given the option whether to mark some such information
        as private or public.  The profile information may also include other
        information we collect, as required by law.</p>

        <p>All other information on the site is to be considered public
        information, and storing private information on this service,
        except for personal account information, is prohibited by the
        terms of service.</p>

        <p>Some use of this site may intrinisically disclose personal
        information.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>When you commit to a Conary archive, the name and contact
            information you provide will be permanently recorded in the
            Conary archive.</li>
            <li>When you send mail to a mailing list, the email address you
            use will be provided in the email that is sent, and will be
            stored in the permanent archives on our site.</li>
            <li>Any information at all that you commit to a Conary archive
            will be publically visible.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These examples are by way of example and not limitation.</p>

        <p>We may collect, analyze, and store detailed and aggregate
        network information, including domain names, in order to
        monitor trends.  We may share or publish this information
        only in aggregate form.</p>

        <p>The full functionality of this site may, at our discretion,
        require the use of "cookies", which store data on your hard
        drive or in memory on your computer.</p>

        <p>This privacy policy applies only to The Service, and not to any
        other services provided by rPath, Inc.  Links on this site to URLs
        not part of The Service are not covered by this privacy policy.</p>

        <p>In order to enhance security and guard the privacy of your
        information, we may take any actions necessary, such as
        security audits by persons or automated tools.  Access to
        your private information will be limited to individuals
        who have a non-disclosure agreement.</p>

        <p>If site security has been compromised in any way, we reserve
        the right to notify and cooperate fully with appropriate
        law enforcement officials, and to take other measures that
        we believe to be appropriate.  If we are aware that your
        private information has been disclosed, we will attempt to
        notify you by email, as soon as possible and permitted by
        law or regulation, of the information we possess related
        to the disclosure of your private information.</p>

        <p>We may change this policy from time to time.  Any such changes
        will not make previously private personal information public,
        unless required by law.  A change to this privacy policy will
        be posted at the following URL <a href="${cfg.basePath}/legal?page=privacy">http://${siteHost}${cfg.basePath}/legal?page=privacy</a>,
        and we will send email to active users notifying them of the change
        15 days prior to change, unless otherwise required by law or regulation.</p>

        <p>This document expresses our policy for maintaining your
        privacy.  We do not guarantee any specific performance under
        these terms.  In particular, circumstances over which we have
        no control may cause your information to be disclosed.  We
        will not be liable if your information is disclosed.</p>

        <p>Your use of any services provided as part of The Service signify
        your acceptance of these terms.</p>
