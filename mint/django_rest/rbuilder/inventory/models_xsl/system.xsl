<xsl:variable name="system_model_dedup"><![CDATA[
Identification of Duplicate System Inventory Entries:
  Because systems can enter inventory in a number of different ways, a single system may initially appear in the inventory multiple times.
  The following information is used to identify these duplicate inventory entries:
    1)  local_uuid and generated_uuid - Systems with identical local and generated UUIDs are guaranteed unique
    2)  target and target_system_id - Virtual targets report a unique ID for each system and thus the combination
           of target and target system ID is guaranteed unique.
    3)  event_uuid - Event UUIDs are used to match system events with an incoming event response and can thus be used
           to lookup a specific system.]]>
