Mailman Integration

      Remove sendmail, and install postfix from conary.rpath.com@rpl:devel

      check that the postfix service is configured to start at boot

      Install mailman from contrib.rpath.com@rpl:noprivate

      set the mailman service to start at boot

      run /var/mailman/bin/mmsitepass # to set a new site password

      modify /var/mailman/Mailman/mm_cfg.py to add MTA='Postfix' {TODO:
      Move this to the noprivate mailman package and add a requirement}

      run /var/mailman/bin/genaliases

      chown mailman:mailman /var/mailman/data/aliases*

      chmod 660 /var/mailman/data/aliases*

      add 'alias_map = hash:/var/mailman/data/aliases' to
      /etc/postfix/main.cf

      Set up a mailman list: run '/var/mailman/bin/newlist mailman' as root

Further configuration may be required to ensure that postfix and mailman
can accept mail for the desired domain.
