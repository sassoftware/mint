rBuilder Installation Instructions

    This document describes the steps necessary to install and configure
rBuilder.

Software Installation

    o Perform an "Everything" installation of rPath Linux

    o Install dnspython from contrib.rpath.com@rpl:devel

        (conary update dnspython)

    o Install rbuilder from *** FIXME pointer to trove? ***

        (conary update rbuilder=*** FIXME pointer to trove? ***)

    o Erase sendmail

        (conary erase sendmail)

    o Install postfix

        (conary update postfix)

    o Install mailmain from contrib.rpath.com@rpl:noprivate

        (conary update mailman=:noprivate)


NOTE: Further configuration may be required to ensure that postfix and
mailman can accept mail for the desired domain.

Postfix Configuration

    o Set the postfix service to start at boot

        (chkconfig postfix on)

    o Start the postfix service

        (/sbin/service postfix start)

    o Edit /etc/postfix/main.cf and change the alias_maps line to read:

        alias_map = hash:/etc/aliases, hash:/var/mailman/data/aliases
      
Mailman Configuration

    o Set the mailman service to start at boot

        (chkconfig mailman on)

    o Start the mailman service

        (/sbin/service mailman start)

    o run /var/mailman/bin/mmsitepass to set a site password for mailman

        (*** FIXME need sample output ***)

      NOTE: Choose this password carefully, as it will be stored -- in
      cleartext -- in a file readable by group apache

    o Using the text editor of your choice, modify the following settings
      in /var/mailman/Mailman/mm_cfg.py:

        - DEFAULT_URL_HOST (Set to fqdn appropriate for your site)
        - DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST (Set to fqdn appropriate for your site)
        - MTA (Set to "Postfix")

        (*** FIXME see Joseph regarding issues regarding getfqdn ***)


    o Run /var/mailman/bin/genaliases to regenerate Mailman-specific
      aliases; ignore any warning messages

    o Run the following command as root:

        /var/mailman/bin/newlist mailman

      (This creates the "mailman" list used to communicate with all mailman
      list owners.)

in authrepo.cnr, no changes except possibly serverName (though joseph may
change to be localhost.localdomain)

***don't use a special password for the mailman site password and the
   mailman list password, as they are stored in plaintext or mailed in
